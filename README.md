## My Process

### Built With
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- **Sass (SCSS) for modular and maintainable CSS**
- CSS custom properties and variables
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Modern workflow with partials, mixins, and functions

### What I Learned
This project helped me improve in several areas:
- Writing **modular and reusable CSS** using Sass (partials, mixins, functions)
- Building responsive layouts using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**
- Implementing **fluid typography** with Sass functions
- Structuring a project using **mobile-first workflow**


### Continued Development
In future iterations, I plan to:
- Implement a using Sass and CSS variables
- Using **design tokens** (colors, spacing, typography) for maintainability.

### Useful Resources
- [Sass Official Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) â€“ for mastering Sass workflow
- and other internet resources.
